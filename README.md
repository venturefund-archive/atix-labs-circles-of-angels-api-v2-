## Prerequisites

- See [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) file

- Configured PostgreSQL database

## Tools and frameworks

- fastify@1.14.3

- solc@0.5.8

- @nomiclabs/buidler@1.1.2

## Creating the database

The schema for the `coadb` database can be found in [schema.sql](./schema.sql).
Execute this script by running `psql -d postgres -a -f schema.sql` to create the database.

## Contributing

Clone the repository by running `git@gitlab.com:atixlabs-oss/circles-of-angels-api.git` and create a new branch from the latest development branch

**Remember not to commit nor push the .env file**

## Development

- ### Setup environment

  - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
  - Run `npx ganache-cli` to start a local ganache instance in `http://localhost:8545`.
  - Create the database either manually as stated above or with Docker by running `cd docker && docker-compose up -d` (this is only for the development environment!!).

- ### Deploy smart contracts with buidler

  - Compile the smart contracts by running `npx buidler compile`.
  - Deploy the compiled contracts to the local network by running `npx buidler deploy`.

- ### Start the server

  - Run `npm start` to start the server in `http://localhost:3001`.

- ### Testing

  - Run `npm test` to run all the API tests.
  - Run `npx buidler test` to run all the smart contracts tests.

## Configuration

- ### Network configuration

  - The `buidler` configuration can be found in [buidler.config.js](./buidler.config.js).
  - Modify the `network` object inside this file to include any other blockchain configuration you may need.
  - Use the `--network` option along with `npx builder` commands to use a different network (e.g, `npx builder deploy --network testnet` to deploy in a testnet specified in the buidler configuration file).


## Whitelisting Addresses

- ### Configuration
  
  Use the script located at `scripts/whiteListMigration.js` to whitelist (or remove from whitelist) a set of user addresses.  
  A file must be provided with the addresses to whitelist (or remove from whitelist) following this model:  
  `0xe5904695748fe4a84b40b3fc79de2277660bd1d3`  
  `0x92561f28ec438ee9831d00d1d59fbdc981b762b2`  
  `0x2ffd013aaa7b5a7da93336c2251075202b33fb2b`  
  `0x9fc9c2dfba3b6cf204c37a5f690619772b926e39`
  
- ### Execution

  To execute the script run this command:
  `npm run whitelist ./addressesToWhitelist.txt`

  This will look for the `addressesToWhitelist.txt` file located in the root folder of the project.  
  
  To give another location, put the full path:  
  `npm run whitelist ./home/atix/coa/addressesToWhitelist.txt`  

  If no parameter is specified, the program will try to import the `./__addressesToWhitelist.txt` in the root folder.
